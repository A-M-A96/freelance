you need these two servers to be able to run the application in you desktop:


1- npm run dev-server


2- php -S 127.0.0.1:8000 -t public


project idea.

the idea of the project is to create a web page where our customers (freelancers) can easily check the list of his/her customers, update them, or completly add new ones.
each freelancer before he/she accesses to the page which contains the list of cusomers need to log in even with email and Password or by using his/her google account.
a new freelancer can always been added to our project by simply sign up.


for the technical information.
the web site is mainly build using jsx which makes the writing of html in react eassier.
for the database I used mysql database 
I also wanted to include an api in my final project since it was an important part which was covered in the first lectures of our course 
and for that reason i used symfony which is a php component this api provides some information such us the http status, and also it provides some statistics graphically.
